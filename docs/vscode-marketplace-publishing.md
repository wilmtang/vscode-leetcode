# VS Code Marketplace Publishing

The VS Code extension is published by `.github/workflows/vscode-extension.yml`.
It uses a separate release tag prefix from the browser extension workflows:

- VS Code Marketplace: `vscode-extension-v<package.json version>`
- Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons: `browser-extension-v<browser-extension/manifest.json version>`

For example, publishing VS Code extension version `0.18.5` uses:

```bash
git tag vscode-extension-v0.18.5
git push origin vscode-extension-v0.18.5
```

Publishing browser extension version `0.1.2` still uses:

```bash
git tag browser-extension-v0.1.2
git push origin browser-extension-v0.1.2
```

## Marketplace Setup

The workflow expects a GitHub Actions environment named `vscode-marketplace`
with one secret:

- `VSCE_PAT`

Create that token from Azure DevOps with these values:

- Organization: `All accessible organizations`
- Scopes: `Custom defined`
- Marketplace: `Manage`

Then create or verify the publisher in the Visual Studio Marketplace publisher
management page:

```text
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/
```

Use the same Microsoft account that owns the Azure DevOps token. The publisher
ID must match `publisher` in `package.json`; this repository currently uses:

```json
"publisher": "wilmtang"
```

If the publisher does not exist yet, create it from the marketplace page. The
required fields are:

- ID: `wilmtang`
- Name: `wilmtang`

After creating the publisher, verify the PAT locally if needed:

```bash
npx vsce login wilmtang
```

## GitHub Setup

In GitHub, open the repository settings and add the secret:

```text
Settings > Environments > vscode-marketplace > Environment secrets > Add secret
```

Use:

- Name: `VSCE_PAT`
- Value: the Azure DevOps Personal Access Token

The environment can optionally require manual approval before publishing. The
workflow still validates and uploads a VSIX artifact without that approval.

## Release Flow

1. Update `package.json` version and `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Merge the release commit to `master`.
3. Push a matching VS Code extension tag:

```bash
git tag vscode-extension-v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
git push origin vscode-extension-v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
```

The publish job verifies that the tag suffix exactly matches `package.json`.
If the version and tag do not match, the job fails before publishing.

You can also run the workflow manually from GitHub Actions with `publish=true`.
Manual publishing uses the current checked-out `package.json` version and does
not require a tag.
