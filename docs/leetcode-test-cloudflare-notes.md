# LeetCode Test Requests, Cloudflare, and Synced Browser Context

This fork has two different LeetCode judge paths:

- `Submit` still uses the bundled `vsc-leetcode-cli submit` command.
- `Test` first uses a direct browser-auth-aware run-code path in `src/request/test-solution.ts`.

The direct `Test` path exists because LeetCode's run-code endpoint can reject the old CLI request shape even when submit still works.

## Original CLI Behavior

The bundled `vsc-leetcode-cli` stores only two values from a copied browser cookie:

- `LEETCODE_SESSION`
- `csrftoken`

Its request signer sends only:

```http
Cookie: LEETCODE_SESSION=<session>;csrftoken=<csrf>;
X-CSRFToken: <csrf>
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
```

It discards other browser cookies, including Cloudflare and routing cookies such as:

- `cf_clearance`
- `INGRESSCOOKIE`
- `ip_check`

This is why the CLI can appear signed in but still fail `test` with:

```text
[ERROR] session expired, please login again [code=-1]
```

That message is from `vsc-leetcode-cli`; it is not the direct browser-auth-aware test request.

## Direct Test Flow

The VS Code `Test` command calls `testSolutionWithSyncedCookie()` before falling back to the CLI. The direct flow:

1. Parses the solution metadata and code from the local solution file.
2. Loads problem metadata with GraphQL.
3. Sends run-code to:

```text
POST https://leetcode.com/problems/<slug>/interpret_solution/
```

with a body like:

```json
{
  "data_input": "...",
  "lang": "python3",
  "question_id": "860",
  "typed_code": "..."
}
```

4. Polls:

```text
GET https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/<interpret_id>/check/
```

The normal browser request does not include `queue_name` or `test_mode`. Those fields exist in LeetCode's frontend bundle only for a separate test-judger/debug mode.

## Default Testcases and Result Cases

LeetCode exposes multiple testcase fields in the GraphQL problem metadata:

- `sampleTestCase` is only the first sample case.
- `exampleTestcaseList` is the preferred browser-style list of default cases.
- `exampleTestcases` is the same default input as one newline-delimited string.

For example, Two Sum returns:

```json
{
  "sampleTestCase": "[2,7,11,15]\n9",
  "exampleTestcaseList": [
    "[2,7,11,15]\n9",
    "[3,2,4]\n6",
    "[3,3]\n6"
  ]
}
```

The browser sends all default cases to `interpret_solution` by joining the testcase list with `\n` and putting that value in the JSON request body as `data_input`. `sampleTestCase` is not a header or cookie; it is a GraphQL response field that can become `data_input` only when the caller chooses it.

The run-code `check` response may include padded result arrays. For Two Sum, LeetCode can return three real cases while arrays such as `code_answer`, `expected_code_answer`, or `std_output_list` contain a trailing empty string:

```json
{
  "code_answer": ["[]", "[]", "[]", ""],
  "expected_code_answer": ["[0,1]", "[1,2]", "[0,1]", ""],
  "std_output_list": ["", "", "", ""],
  "compare_result": "000",
  "total_testcases": 3
}
```

The result page must not render the trailing empty array entry as an extra case. Use `total_testcases` as the display case count when it is present, then fall back to `compare_result.length`, then input count, and only then non-empty output/expected/stdout values.

## Test Execution Order

The `Test` command currently tries requests in this order:

1. Direct Node/Axios request using the synced browser cookie and stored browser headers.
2. If Node/Axios receives a Cloudflare challenge page, retry the same request through system `curl`.
3. If the direct path is unsupported before contacting the judge, fall back to `vsc-leetcode-cli test`.

The CLI fallback is only for compatibility cases such as missing synced cookie, unsupported file metadata, or another condition where the direct path cannot be built. It is not used for a confirmed LeetCode or Cloudflare rejection from the direct path, because the CLI error hides the real cause.

In short:

```text
VS Code Test
  -> direct Node/Axios run-code request
  -> curl retry only when Node/Axios gets Cloudflare "Just a moment..."
  -> leetcode-cli test only when direct test is unsupported before judge rejection
```

Older behavior fell through to `vsc-leetcode-cli test` even after direct run-code was rejected, which produced misleading output such as:

```text
[ERROR] session expired, please login again [code=-1]
```

## Cloudflare Behavior

LeetCode sits behind Cloudflare. A Node/Axios request can receive a Cloudflare challenge page:

```html
<title>Just a moment...</title>
```

even when a copied Chrome `curl` command succeeds from Terminal. That means the failure is not simply LeetCode login state. The successful browser request carries a fuller browser context, including:

- full `Cookie` header with `cf_clearance`
- Chrome `User-Agent`
- Chrome Client Hints such as `sec-ch-ua*`
- request context headers such as `sec-fetch-*`
- other browser headers such as `dnt`, `priority`, and `accept-language`

`cf_clearance` is a cookie. It is sent inside the `Cookie` header, not as a standalone header.

## What Auth Sync Stores

The browser extension syncs multiple pieces of browser context to VS Code:

- full LeetCode cookie string
- browser user-agent
- sanitized LeetCode XHR request headers observed from real browser requests

The stored request headers are intentionally limited to replayable browser metadata:

- `accept`
- `accept-language`
- `authorization`
- `dnt`
- `priority`
- `sec-ch-ua`
- `sec-ch-ua-arch`
- `sec-ch-ua-bitness`
- `sec-ch-ua-full-version`
- `sec-ch-ua-full-version-list`
- `sec-ch-ua-mobile`
- `sec-ch-ua-model`
- `sec-ch-ua-platform`
- `sec-ch-ua-platform-version`
- `sec-fetch-dest`
- `sec-fetch-mode`
- `sec-fetch-site`
- `user-agent`

Sensitive and request-specific values such as `Cookie`, `Origin`, `Referer`, and `X-CSRFToken` are generated by the VS Code request path from the latest synced cookie and current problem slug.

## Cookie-Only Sync Versus Real Browser Requests

`Cookie-only sync` can sync cookies and the browser extension's user-agent. It cannot sync the real `sec-ch-ua*` and `sec-fetch-*` headers because those are only visible when Chrome actually sends a LeetCode request.

To refresh stored browser request headers:

1. Reload the browser extension after changing it.
2. Click `Expire now` in the browser extension popup, then open or refresh a LeetCode problem page, or click `Run` in the browser once.
3. Check the VS Code LeetCode output for:

```text
[auth-sync] Captured N browser request headers for direct judge requests.
```

`Cookie-only sync` with no observed request headers does not clear previously stored headers. It updates cookie and user-agent only.

## Lazy Sync Behavior

Browser sync is intentionally lazy once the VS Code LeetCode extension is already signed in:

- If VS Code is signed out, sync performs the full login/session setup.
- If VS Code is already signed in, sync only stores latest cookie, user-agent, and request headers.

Lazy sync does not rewrite the CLI session, emit `statusChanged`, show a new "signed in as..." notification, or refresh the problem list.

## Curl Fallback

If the Node/Axios direct request receives a Cloudflare challenge page, the direct test path retries the same request through system `curl`. This is meant to match the manually copied Chrome curl workflow more closely.

The fallback still depends on the synced browser context. If `curl` also receives the Cloudflare challenge page, the plugin logs the real direct failure instead of falling back to the old CLI and hiding the cause.

## Current Scope

Only the VS Code `Test` path uses the synced full cookie, browser headers, and curl fallback.

`Submit` still uses `vsc-leetcode-cli submit`, so it does not send `cf_clearance` or the captured browser request headers.
