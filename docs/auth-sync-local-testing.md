# LeetCode Browser Auth Sync Local Testing

This fork adds a browser-to-VS Code cookie sync path for local LeetCode auth.
For notes on the `Test` command, Cloudflare challenge handling, full-cookie replay,
and captured browser request headers, see
[LeetCode Test Requests, Cloudflare, and Synced Browser Context](./leetcode-test-cloudflare-notes.md).

The browser extension reads the current `leetcode.com` cookies from the browser and sends them to the VS Code extension over a loopback HTTP endpoint. The VS Code extension then reuses the existing cookie login path so both auth stores are updated:

- VS Code extension global state
- Bundled `vsc-leetcode-cli` session/cache used by test and submit

## What Changed

VS Code extension:

- Added `src/auth/authSyncServer.ts`.
- The server listens on `127.0.0.1` only.
- Default endpoint: `POST http://127.0.0.1:17899/auth/update`.
- Default secret behavior: no secret required.
- Optional secret header: `X-LeetCode-AuthSync-Secret`.
- Added settings:
  - `leetcode.authSync.enabled`
  - `leetcode.authSync.port`
  - `leetcode.authSync.ownerHeartbeatIntervalSeconds`
  - `leetcode.authSync.observerCheckIntervalSeconds`
  - `leetcode.authSync.ownerStaleAfterSeconds`
  - `leetcode.authSync.secret`
- Added commands:
  - `LeetCode: Show Browser Auth Sync Status`
  - `LeetCode: Restart Browser Auth Sync Server`
  - `LeetCode: Force Start Browser Auth Sync Server`
- Added single-owner coordination for multiple VS Code windows. The owner window listens on the configured port, exposes `/health`, and writes metadata to VS Code global state for diagnostics and force-release. Other windows use `/health` to verify live ownership and can take over when the listener is gone.
- Added `Auto Cookie Sync` to the login picker as the recommended sign-in path.
- Refactored cookie login into `leetCodeManager.updateSessionFromCookie(cookie)` so manual cookie login, URI login, and browser sync all update the same session path.

Browser extension:

- Added `browser-extension/`.
- Chrome loads `browser-extension/manifest.json` as an MV3 service worker extension.
- Firefox loads `browser-extension/manifest.json` and uses the `background.scripts` declaration.
- Added browser extension icons at all required extension sizes.
- Automatic sync observes only LeetCode XHR/fetch request cookie headers.
- MV3 browsers that do not expose request cookie headers can fall back to reading cookies through the cookies API.
- Sends the full LeetCode `Cookie` header to the local VS Code listener.
- Syncs on popup/options click or eligible LeetCode XHR/fetch requests.
- Applies a configurable cooldown after each successful automatic sync. Default: 30 minutes.
- `Expire now` from the popup clears the cooldown so the next real LeetCode request can sync immediately. The optional `Cookie-only sync` action sends cookies without browser request headers.
- Popup last/next sync timers are rounded to minutes.
- Exposes options for enabled state, port, optional shared secret, and cooldown.

## Quick Local Test

Install dependencies first:

```bash
npm ci --replace-registry-host=always
```

Start VS Code in extension-development mode:

```bash
npm run local -- vscode:dev
```

Start Chrome with the unpacked browser extension loaded in a disposable test profile:

```bash
npm run local -- chrome:dev
```

Then:

1. In the Chrome test profile, log in to `https://leetcode.com`.
2. In VS Code, click `Sign in to LeetCode` and choose `Auto Cookie Sync`.
3. Click the LeetCode Auth Sync browser extension icon.
4. Click `Expire now`, then open or refresh any `leetcode.com` page.
5. Confirm the VS Code waiting notification closes and the LeetCode side bar reloads as signed in.
6. Run a problem test or submit command to confirm the bundled CLI session was updated too.

## Start the VS Code Extension Listener

The auth sync listener starts automatically when the VS Code extension activates.

For local development, use:

```bash
npm run local -- vscode:dev
```

That command compiles the extension and opens VS Code with this checkout as the extension-development path. The server listens on:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:17899
```

The receiver endpoint is:

```text
POST http://127.0.0.1:17899/auth/update
```

The health endpoint is:

```text
GET http://127.0.0.1:17899/health
```

To inspect listener state, open the VS Code Command Palette and run:

```text
LeetCode: Show Browser Auth Sync Status
```

To restart it:

```text
LeetCode: Restart Browser Auth Sync Server
```

To make the current VS Code window take ownership of the configured port:

```text
LeetCode: Force Start Browser Auth Sync Server
```

If another VS Code window owns the listener, that command verifies the owner through `/health`, asks it to release the listener, and then starts the server in the current window. If another program owns the port, the command does not kill it; it reports the process it found and writes copyable inspect/stop commands to the LeetCode output channel.

If you need another port, set `leetcode.authSync.port` in VS Code settings. The server restarts when the setting changes.

For multi-window timing, these settings default to conservative values:

- `leetcode.authSync.ownerHeartbeatIntervalSeconds`: `30`
- `leetcode.authSync.observerCheckIntervalSeconds`: `60`

Owner liveness is decided by `GET /health`, not by the shared heartbeat record alone. If a stale owner record remains after VS Code exits but the port is free, status reports that no live owner is present and an observer can claim the listener on its next check.

## Install the VS Code Extension Locally

For a real local install instead of an extension-development host, run:

```bash
npm run local -- vscode:install
```

This script:

1. Compiles TypeScript.
2. Packages a VSIX into `dist/vscode-leetcode-auth-sync.vsix`.
3. Removes the old stock extension ID and the previous local auth-sync extension ID if present.
4. Installs that VSIX using the `code --install-extension` CLI.

If the script cannot find the `code` command, install it from VS Code:

```text
Command Palette > Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH
```

You can also point the script at a custom VS Code CLI:

```bash
VSCODE_BIN=/absolute/path/to/code npm run local -- vscode:install
```

After installation, reload VS Code and run:

```text
LeetCode: Show Browser Auth Sync Status
```

## Install the Browser Extension for Local Testing

### Automated Chrome Test Profile

Use:

```bash
npm run local -- chrome:dev
```

This opens Chrome or Chromium with:

- a disposable profile under your temp directory
- the unpacked extension loaded from `browser-extension/`
- `https://leetcode.com` opened

If Chrome cannot be found, pass its path explicitly:

```bash
CHROME_BIN="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" npm run local -- chrome:dev
```

### Automated Chrome Current Profile

For local convenience, you can launch Chrome with your existing user-data directory and the unpacked extension:

```bash
npm run local -- chrome:dev-current
```

This uses Chrome's last-used profile from the local `Local State` file when possible. If Chrome is already running, quit Chrome first; Chrome may route the command to the existing process and ignore `--load-extension`.

This is not a silent permanent install. Chrome intentionally requires user action, enterprise policy, or startup flags for unpacked extensions in normal profiles.

### Manual Chrome Install

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable `Developer mode`.
3. Click `Load unpacked`.
4. Select this folder:

```text
browser-extension/
```

To print the absolute path:

```bash
npm run local -- paths
```

Chrome uses the MV3 `background.service_worker` declaration from `browser-extension/manifest.json`. Firefox ignores the service worker declaration and uses the `background.scripts` declaration from the same manifest.

### Manual Firefox Install

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click `Load Temporary Add-on`.
3. Select `browser-extension/manifest.json`.

Firefox release builds do not provide a safe command for silently and permanently installing an unsigned unpacked extension into the current normal profile. Use the temporary add-on flow above for development, or package/sign the extension for a persistent install.

## Shared Secret Testing

By default, no secret is required.

To test secret-protected sync:

1. In VS Code settings, set `leetcode.authSync.secret` to a test value such as `abc123`.
2. In the browser extension options page, set the same optional shared secret.
3. In the browser extension popup, click `Expire now`, then open or refresh any `leetcode.com` page.

Expected result: sync succeeds.

To test failure:

1. Keep VS Code set to `abc123`.
2. Set the browser extension secret to `wrong`.
3. In the browser extension popup, click `Expire now`, then open or refresh any `leetcode.com` page.

Expected result: the browser extension reports `Invalid auth sync secret.` and VS Code does not update the cookie.

## Script Reference

```bash
npm run local -- vscode:dev
```

Compile and open VS Code with this checkout as an extension-development host.

```bash
npm run local -- vscode:install
```

Compile, package a VSIX, and install it into VS Code.

```bash
npm run local -- chrome:dev
```

Open Chrome or Chromium with the unpacked browser extension loaded in a disposable profile.

```bash
npm run local -- chrome:dev-current
```

Open Chrome or Chromium with the unpacked browser extension loaded against the current Chrome user-data directory. Quit Chrome first for the flag to take effect.

```bash
npm run local -- paths
```

Print useful local paths, including the browser extension path and VSIX output path.

```bash
npm run local -- icons
```

Regenerate `browser-extension/icons/icon.svg` plus the 16, 32, 48, and 128 pixel PNG icons referenced by both manifests.

## Manual Endpoint Smoke Test

With the VS Code extension running, this should reach the local server but fail unless the fake cookie passes LeetCode's real session checks:

```bash
curl -i \
  -X POST \
  http://127.0.0.1:17899/auth/update \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"cookie":"LEETCODE_SESSION=fake; csrftoken=fake","reason":"manual-smoke-test"}'
```

Use the browser extension for an end-to-end test with real browser cookies.

## Privacy Notes

Cookie values are never intentionally logged by the VS Code extension or browser extension.

Automatic browser sync observes only `xmlhttprequest`/fetch requests to `https://leetcode.com/*`, sends only to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/auth/update`, and will not send again until the configured cooldown has elapsed after the last successful automatic sync. `Expire now` clears that cooldown so the next real LeetCode request can sync immediately.

The VS Code listener binds only to `127.0.0.1`, not `0.0.0.0`, so it is not reachable from other devices on the local network.
