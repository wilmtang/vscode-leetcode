# Change Log
All notable changes to the "leetcode" extension will be documented in this file.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **Status bar profile panel**: clicking the `LeetCode: <username>` status bar
  item opens a personal-stats webview with total solved counts, Easy/Medium/Hard
  progress bars against the full catalog, "Beats %" per difficulty, global
  ranking, country/company/school, language breakdown, and the 10 most recent
  Accepted submissions. The same view is reachable via
  `LeetCode: Show User Profile`. When signed out, the status bar click opens the
  sign-in picker instead of being a dead-end.

### Security
- **Credentials moved to the OS keychain (audit 2 / A2-1).** The synced LeetCode
  session cookie, browser user-agent, and captured request headers are now stored
  in VS Code `SecretStorage` instead of plaintext `globalState`. Existing
  plaintext values are migrated into the keychain on first launch and the old
  copies deleted, so upgrades don't sign you out.
- **Constant-time secret comparison (A2-4).** The auth-sync shared secret and the
  port-release control token are now compared with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`.
- **curl fallback no longer leaks the cookie via argv (A2-5).** The Cloudflare
  curl fallback passes the cookie, auth headers, and request body through a config
  file on stdin (`curl -K -`) instead of command-line arguments, so they no longer
  appear in the host process list.
- **Untrusted-markup hardening (A2-6).** Dropped the `file:` link allowance from
  the markdown renderer and neutralize `javascript:`/`vbscript:`/`file:` URLs in
  rendered href/src — closes a phishing / NTLM-leak vector in community solutions.

### Fixed
- `Show Top Voted Solution` now fetches the overall top-voted community solution
  instead of filtering by the configured/default language, and hides LeetCode's
  markdown-template HTML comments from the rendered solution body.
- Cloudflare "Just a moment…" challenges served with a **200/503** status now
  correctly trigger the curl fallback instead of being parsed as real data (A2-9).
- The profile panel no longer blanks its already-loaded sections when a
  `markdown.*` setting changes while it's open (A2-7).
- Observer VS Code windows now refresh the status-bar tooltip and the open
  profile "Session Sync" card when another window performs an auth sync (A2-8).
- The auth-sync observer check now serializes its state writes with start/stop
  transitions, preventing a transient wrong status under concurrency (A2-11).
- `mapCnProblem` now carries the internal `questionId`, matching the other problem
  mappers (A2-10; `leetcode.cn` remains untested overall).

### Changed
- Removed the unused `leetcode.authSync.ownerStaleAfterSeconds` setting (A2-13).
- Documented intentional design decisions (open-by-default local sync endpoint,
  `vscode://?cookie=` sign-in) in `AGENTS.md` so future audits don't re-flag them.

## [0.19.0]
### Changed
- The extension now talks to LeetCode **directly over HTTP/GraphQL** using the synced browser cookie, instead of bundling and shelling out to `vsc-leetcode-cli`. **Node.js is no longer required** to run the extension.
- Problem list, problem descriptions, code-file generation, startup sign-in, favorites, and top-voted solutions are all fetched through the direct API. Descriptions and solutions now render LaTeX math via KaTeX.
- Generated solution files embed the canonical `https://leetcode.com/problems/<slug>/` URL in the `@lc` header, so Test/Submit recover the problem slug even with custom filename configurations.

### Removed
- The **Manage Sessions** feature — LeetCode retired the underlying session API.
- The bundled `vsc-leetcode-cli` (and `require-from-string`, `unescape-js`) dependencies and the `leetcode.nodePath` setting.

### Notes
- Validated against `leetcode.com`. `leetcode.cn` support is inherited from the upstream extension and has not been freshly tested by this fork.

## [0.18.12]
### Added
- Publish VS Code extension releases to the Open VSX Registry.

### Changed
- Render LeetCode run results with example testcase labels and the total testcase count.
- Clarify auth-sync, telemetry, and LeetCode testcase documentation.

## [0.18.11]
### Added
- Replay browser-captured LeetCode request headers, including Firefox headers, when running test cases so auth-sync requests better match the signed-in browser session.

### Changed
- Store browser sync data without forcing an immediate login-state refresh, allowing cookie-only sync updates to remain lightweight.

### Fixed
- Improve authenticated LeetCode test requests for the current judger flow.

## [0.18.10]
### Fixed
- Treat the auth sync `/health` endpoint as the source of truth for listener ownership so stale VS Code global state cannot block a reopened window from claiming a free port.

## [0.18.9]
### Fixed
- Restore LeetCode test execution through the auth-sync request flow when the standard CLI test path cannot complete with the current LeetCode auth behavior.

## [0.18.8]
### Fixed
- Keep multiline testcase examples fully commented in generated problem files.

## [0.18.7]
### Added
- Coordinate browser auth sync ownership across multiple VS Code windows with configurable heartbeat, observer check, and stale-owner timings.
- Add `LeetCode: Force Start Browser Auth Sync Server` to move listener ownership to the current VS Code window when the port is owned by this extension.

### Fixed
- Read auth cookies, user status, and sync timestamps from shared VS Code global state so observer windows do not keep stale in-memory auth state.

## [0.18.6]
### Added
- Show the last successful browser cookie sync time first in the auth sync status command.

- change graphql path
